# Berry on Propeller 2

This directory holds the P2-specific notes that sit closest to the runtime and bring-up work.

## Layout

- `../include/` contains the P2 configuration shim and small public headers.
- `../runtime/` contains the P2 entry point, serial backend, and heap implementation.
- `../overrides/` contains the small maintained override layer used by the port.
- `../patches/optional/` contains temporary or host-specific workaround files.
- `../tests/` contains tiny on-target probes for serial, loading, and allocation.

## Current Goal

Bring up a basic Berry REPL on Propeller 2 with:

- `print()`
- variable assignment
- simple arithmetic
- reliable serial interaction
